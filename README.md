# Userscript metadata block templates

The repo has metadata templates for [userscripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript). Metadata section describes a script (its name, version etc) and usually present at the top of the userscript file. Userscripts are run by special browser extension.


## Metadata compatibility

Along with standard keys, some extensions support uniques. Refer to their documentation to know more:

- Greasemonkey [metadata keys](https://wiki.greasespot.net/Metadata_Block). These keys should work in any userscript extension.
- Violentmonkey [metadata keys](https://violentmonkey.github.io/api/metadata-block/).
- Tampermonkey [metadata keys](https://www.tampermonkey.net/documentation.php#metadata). This extension has quite a lot of unique keys.
- greasyfork.org [metadata keys](https://greasyfork.org/en/help/meta-keys). While this is not an extension but a place to host userscripts, it also supports several unique keys, so if you want to publish your script there, it is worth to use them.
